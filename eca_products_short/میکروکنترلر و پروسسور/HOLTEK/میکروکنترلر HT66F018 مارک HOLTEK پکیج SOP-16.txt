Introduction

The device is a Flash Memory type 8-bit high performance RISC architecture microcontroller.
Offering users the convenience of Flash Memory multi-programming features, the device also includes a wide range of functions and features. Other memory includes an area of RAM Data Memory as well as an area of true EEPROM memory for storage of non-volatile data such as serial numbers, calibration data etc.
Analog features include a multi-channel 12-bit A/D converter and a comparator functions. Multiple and extremely flexible Timer Modules provide timing, pulse generation and PWM generation functions. Protective features such as an internal Watchdog Timer, Low Voltage Reset and Low Voltage Detector coupled with excellent noise immunity and ESD protection ensure that reliable operation is maintained in hostile electrical environments.
A full choice of HXT, LXT, HIRC and LIRC oscillator functions are provided including a fully integrated system oscillator which requires no external components for its implementation. The ability to operate and switch dynamically between a range of operating modes using different clock sources gives users the ability to optimise microcontroller operation and minimize power consumption.
The inclusion of flexible I/O programming features, Time Base functions along with many other features ensure that the device will find excellent use in applications such as electronic metering,environmental monitoring, handheld instruments, household appliances, electronically controlled tools, motor driving in addition to many others.

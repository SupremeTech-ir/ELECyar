Introduction

The Am29F400B is a 4 Mbit, 5.0 volt-only Flash memory organized as 524,288 bytes or 262,144 words. The device is offered in 44-pin SO and 48-pin TSOP packages. The word-wide data (x16) appears on DQ15–DQ0; the byte-wide (x8) data appears on DQ7–DQ0. This device is designed to be programmed insystem with the standard system 5.0 volt VCC supply. A 12.0V VPP is not required for write or erase operations. The device can also be programmed in standard EPROM programmers.

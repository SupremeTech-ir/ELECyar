Description

The series of devices are A/D Flash Memory type 8-bit high performance RISC architecture microcontrollers with fully integrated touch key functions. With all touch key functions provided internally and with the convenience of Flash Memory multi-programming features, each device has all the features to offer designers a reliable and easy means of implementing touch keys within their products applications.

In addition to the Flash program memory, other memory includes an area of RAM Data Memory as well as an area of true EEPROM memory for storage of non-volatile data such as serial numbers, calibration data etc. Analog feature includes a multi-channel 12-bit A/D converter. Protective features such as an internal Watchdog Timer, Low Voltage Reset and Low Voltage Detector coupled with excellent noise immunity and ESD protection ensure that reliable operation is maintained in hostile electrical environments.

A full choice of external and internal, high and low speed oscillators are provided and can be flexibly used for different applications. The ability to operate and switch dynamically between a range of operating modes using different clock sources gives users the ability to optimise microcontroller operation and minimise power consumption. Easy communication with the outside world is provided using the internal SPI, I2C and UART interfaces, while the inclusion of flexible I/O programming features, Time Base functions, Timer Modules and many other features further enhance device functionality and flexibility.

The touch key devices will find excellent use in a huge range of modern Touch Key product applications such as remote control, instrumentation, household appliances such as electric rice cookers and electronically controlled tools to name but a few.

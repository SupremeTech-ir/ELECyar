Introduction

The µPD6379 and 6379A are 2-channel 16-bit D/A converters for digital audio signal demodulation. These D/A converters employ the resistor string conversion method which has been tested by existing model µPD6376 but they are more compact and require fewer external components than the µPD6376. In addition, low-voltage models, the
µPD6379L and 6379AL (minimum operating supply voltage +3.0 V) are also available for applications in portable

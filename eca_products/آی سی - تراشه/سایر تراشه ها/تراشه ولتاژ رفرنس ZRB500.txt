Introduction

The ZRB500 uses a bandgap circuit design to achieve a precision micropower voltage reference of 5.0 volts. The device is available in small outline surface-mount packages, ideal for applications where space saving is important, as well as packages for through-hole requirements.
The ZRB500 design provides a stable voltage without an external capacitor and is stable with capacitive loads. The ZRB500 is recommended for operation between 50_A and 15mA and so is ideally suited to low power and battery-powered applications.
Excellent performance is maintained to an absolute maximum of 25mA, however, the rugged design and 20-volt processing allow the reference to withstand transient effects and currents up to 200mA. Superior switching capability allows the device to reach stable operating conditions in only a few microseconds.

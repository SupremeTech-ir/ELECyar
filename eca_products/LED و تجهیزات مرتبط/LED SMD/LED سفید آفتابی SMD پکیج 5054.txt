Introduction

The SMD LED Module (surface-mount device light-emitting diode module) is a type of LED module that uses surface-mount technology (SMT) to mount LED chips on printed circuit boards (PCB). It is a self-contained surface-mount LED device designed either to function on its own or to plug into a compatible unit. The types of SMD LED Modules are distinguished by the dimensions of the LED package. The package dimension of SMD LED 5054 is 5.0mm*5.4mm.

Moonlight 5054 SMD LED is a collection of compact devices, 5.0mm*5.4mm, that allows for design freedom and provides a superior overall system solution when a project requires high flux output and good efficacy. The Moonlight 5054 SMD LED is color targeted for application needs and delivers efficiency and reliability for a variety of applications.

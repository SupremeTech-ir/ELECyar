Introduction

The TVP5160 device is a high quality, digital video decoder that digitizes and decodes all popular baseband analog video formats into digital component video. The TVP5160 decoder supports the A/D conversion of component YPbPr and RGB (SCART) signals, as well as the A/D conversion and decoding of NTSC, PAL, and SECAM composite and S-Video into component YCbCr. Additionally, component progressive signals can be digitized. The chip includes two 11-bit, 60-MSPS, A/D converters (ADCs). Prior to each ADC, each analog channel contains an analog circuit, which clamps the input to a reference voltage and applies a programmable gain and offset. A total of 12 video input terminals can be configured to a combination of YPbPr, RGB, CVBS, and S-Video video inputs.

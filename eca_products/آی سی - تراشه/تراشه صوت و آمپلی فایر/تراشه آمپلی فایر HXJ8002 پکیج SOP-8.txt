Introduction
The 8002 is an audio power amplifier primarily designed for demanding applications in low-power portable
systems. It is capable of delivering 3 watts of continuous average power to an 3Ω BTL load with less than 10%
distortion (THD) from a 5VDC power supply. the 8002 does not require output coupling capacitors or bootstrap
capacitors, and therefore is ideally suited for mobile phone and other low voltage applications where minimal power
consumption is a primary requirement.the 8002 features a low-power consumption shutdown mode.the 8002 contains
advanced pop & click circuitry which eliminates noise which would otherwise occur during turn-on and turn-off
transitions. The 8002 is unity-gain stable and can be configured by external gain-setting resistors

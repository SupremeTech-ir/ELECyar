Introduction

The devices are Flash Memory type 8-bit high performance RISC architecture microcontrollers. Offering users the convenience of Flash Memory multi-programming features, these devices also
include a wide range of functions and features. Other memory includes an area of RAM Data Memory as well as an area of true EEPROM memory for storage of non-volatile data such as serial numbers, calibration data etc.
Analog features include multiple and extremely flexible Timer Modules provide timing, pulse generation, capture input, compare match output and PWM generation functions. Protective features such as an internal Watchdog Timer and Low Voltage Reset and Low Voltage Detector coupled with excellent noise immunity and ESD protection ensure that reliable operation is maintained in hostile
electrical environments.
A full choice of HIRC and LIRC oscillator functions are provided including a fully integrated system oscillator which requires no external components for its implementation.
The inclusion of flexible I/O programming features, Time-Base functions along with many other features ensure that the devices will find excellent use in applications such as electronic metering,environmental monitoring, handheld instruments, household appliances, electronically controlled tools, motor driving in addition to many others.
